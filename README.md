# Rally-Cats
A Pong-like arcade game with cats.

This is a personal project I worked on to gain a better understanding of UI creation and collisions in Unity Engine.
The repository contains all of the assets used for the creation of the game, as well as the build files for the game.

You can also download the game as a zip file through my itch.io page: https://n3onnarwhal.itch.io/rally-cats
